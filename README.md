This repository is devoted to the source codes for the web-application () for the cost-rate computation of the "".

Welcome to the source code for our Streamlit app. This application computes the cost-rate for a hybrid inspection and age-based maintenance policy for single-component systems following a four-phase degradation process and subject to shocks, which cause immediate transitions of states. The app was developed by Victor H. R. Lima, EugÃªnio A. S. Fischetti and Cristiano A. V. Cavalcante.
