This repository is devoted to the source codes for the web-application (https://kmtfourphaseschockp-3jrf2lxktc3wtquax6nqsx.streamlit.app/) for the cost-rate computation of the "Multi-Level Inspection and Age-Based Maintenance under Shocks: A Simulation-Analytical Optimization Approach".

Welcome to the source code for our Streamlit app. This application computes the cost-rate for an hybrid multi-level inspection and age-based maintenance policy for single-component systems following a four-phase degradation process and subject to shocks, which cause immediate transitions of states. The app was developed by Victor H. R. Lima, EugÃªnio A. S. Fischetti and Cristiano A. V. Cavalcante.
